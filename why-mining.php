    Why is Trading so important?

<div class="color-2 my-3 fw-normal">
The stock market is an important part of the economy of a country. The stock market plays a play a pivotal role in the growth of the industry and commerce of the country eventually affecting the economy of the country to a great extent. That is the reason that the government, industry, and even the central banks of the country join and keep a close watch on the happenings of the stock market. It's also important from the investorâ€™s point of view.

<div class="text-secondary fw-light my-3">
    
    The stock market is the primary source for anyone, companies, or institution to raise funds. If a company wants to raise some capital for the business it can issue its shares for capitalization. 

    This is the primary function of stock Trading, they play the most important role in supporting the growth of the industry and commerce in the country. That is the reason that a rising stock market is the sign of a developing industrial sector, growing the economy, and helping individuals. 

    Of course, this is just the primary function of the stock market and just an half of the role that the stock market plays. The secondary function of the stock market is that the market plays the role of a common platform for the buyers and sellers of these stocks that are listed on the stock market. It is the secondary market of the stock exchange where retail investors and institutional investors buy and sell the stocks that are trading. In fact, it is these stock market traders who raise the fund for the businesses by investing in the stocks.

    For investing in the stocks or to trade in the stock the investors have to go through the brokers of the stock market. Brokers execute the buy and sell orders of the investors and settle the deals to keep the stock trading alive. The brokers basically act as a middle man between the buyers and sellers. Once the buyer places a buy order in the stock market the brokers find a seller of the stock and thus the deal is closed. All these take place in the stock market and it is the demand and supply of the stock of a company that determines the price of the stock of that particular company.

    So the stock market is not only providing the much-required funds for boosting business and giving out returns, but also providing a common place for stock trading. It is the stock market that makes the stocks a liquid asset, unlike the real estate investment. It is the stock market that makes it possible to trade the stocks at any point in time and get back the investment along with the profit. This makes the stocks much more liquid in nature and thereby attracts investors to invest in the stock market.
